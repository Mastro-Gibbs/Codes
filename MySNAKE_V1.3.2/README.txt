To move the snake use:
- 'w' to go up
- 'a' to go left
- 'd' to go right
- 's' to go down
It's the same if you want to use upper or lower case!

There is a special apple called 'golden apple' who can spawn
randomly when you play, but it's really hard for this to
happen. You only have one golden apple per game worth 
10,000 points.

If you want to save the current score
remember that it will overwrite the game record,
so save the score only if it's greather than the 
game record.
